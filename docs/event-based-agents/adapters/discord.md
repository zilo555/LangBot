# Discord EBA Adapter

## Status

Discord has been migrated from the legacy source adapter:

```text
src/langbot/pkg/platform/sources/discord.py
src/langbot/pkg/platform/sources/discord.yaml
```

EBA adapter directory:

```text
src/langbot/pkg/platform/adapters/discord/
├── adapter.py
├── api_impl.py
├── event_converter.py
├── manifest.yaml
├── message_converter.py
├── platform_api.py
├── types.py
└── voice.py
```

The adapter is registered as `discord-omni`.

## Configuration

| Field | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `client_id` | Yes | `""` | Discord application client ID. |
| `token` | Yes | `""` | Discord bot token. |

The bot needs gateway permissions and intents for the target test server. Message Content intent is required for message bodies, Server Members intent is required for member APIs/events, and reaction events require the Reactions intent and channel permissions.

## Events

Discord declares these EBA events:

- `message.received`
- `message.edited`
- `message.deleted`
- `message.reaction`
- `group.member_joined`
- `group.member_left`
- `bot.invited_to_group`
- `bot.removed_from_group`
- `platform.specific`

Discord-specific events that do not map cleanly to common events should be surfaced as `platform.specific`.

## Common APIs

| API | Status | Notes |
|-----|-----------------|-------|
| `send_message` | Supported | Supports text, image, file, and mixed message chains through Discord messages and attachments. |
| `reply_message` | Supported | Uses Discord message references when replying to a received EBA message event. |
| `edit_message` | Supported | Bot can edit its own messages. File edits are implemented by clearing old attachments and sending replacement files when needed. |
| `delete_message` | Supported | Requires message management permissions for non-bot messages. |
| `forward_message` | Emulated | Discord has no native forward API; the adapter copies content and attachments. |
| `get_group_info` | Supported | Maps Discord guild metadata to EBA group info. |
| `get_group_member_list` | Supported | Requires member cache or the Server Members intent/fetch permission. |
| `get_group_member_info` | Supported | Maps Discord roles/permissions into EBA member roles. |
| `get_user_info` | Supported | Uses Discord user fetch/cache. |
| `upload_file` | Not supported | Discord uploads files as message attachments; standalone upload raises `NotSupportedError`. |
| `get_file_url` | Supported | Discord attachment URLs are already downloadable URLs, so the adapter returns the input URL. |
| `mute_member` | Supported where possible | Uses Discord timeout API and requires guild moderation permission. |
| `unmute_member` | Supported where possible | Clears timeout and requires guild moderation permission. |
| `kick_member` | Supported | Destructive; test only with a disposable account/bot. |
| `leave_group` | Supported | Bot leaves a guild; destructive and should run last. |
| `call_platform_api` | Supported | Discord-specific actions live here. |

## Platform-Specific APIs

`call_platform_api(action, params)` supports:

- `get_channel`
- `get_guild`
- `get_guild_channels`
- `get_guild_roles`
- `create_invite`
- `pin_message`
- `unpin_message`
- `add_reaction`
- `remove_reaction`
- `typing`

Voice helpers are intentionally kept Discord-specific:

- `join_voice_channel`
- `leave_voice_channel`
- `get_voice_connection_status`
- `list_active_voice_connections`
- `get_voice_channel_info`

## Live Test Record

The live probe is:

```bash
uv run python tests/e2e/live_discord_eba_probe.py --help
```

Verified on May 7, 2026 with a newly created Discord application/bot named `LangBot EBA Test 0507`, the LangBot Discord server, and the `#🐞-debugging` channel:

- SDK standalone runtime started with WebSocket control/debug ports, and the `EBAEventProbe` plugin connected through `lbp run`.
- Plugin runtime received real Discord events through LangBot: `BotInvitedToGroup`, `MessageReceived`, `MessageReactionReceived` add/remove, `MessageEdited`, and `MessageDeleted`.
- Plugin runtime API calls succeeded through the standalone runtime: `get_langbot_version`, `get_bots`, `get_bot_info`, `send_message`, plugin storage APIs, workspace storage APIs, `list_plugins_manifest`, `list_commands`, `list_tools`, and `list_knowledge_bases`.
- Direct live adapter probe observed `message.received`, `message.edited`, `message.deleted`, and `bot.removed_from_group`.
- Message APIs verified: send, reply, edit, delete, forward, text/image/file mixed message chains.
- User and guild APIs verified: `get_user_info`, `get_group_info`, `get_group_member_list`, `get_group_member_info`.
- Platform-specific APIs verified: `get_channel`, `get_guild`, `get_guild_channels`, `get_guild_roles`, `create_invite`, `typing`, `pin_message`, `unpin_message`, `add_reaction`, `remove_reaction`.
- Unsupported API behavior verified: `upload_file` raises `NotSupportedError`.
- Destructive API verified at the end: `leave_group`, which emitted `bot.removed_from_group`.

Not verified in the shared LangBot server live run: `mute_member`, `unmute_member`, and `kick_member`, because the run did not use a disposable target member. They are implemented through Discord timeout/kick APIs and should only be exercised against a disposable account or bot.

The test fixed one real test-fixture issue: `EBAEventProbe` previously assumed `get_bots()` returned UUID strings. The current standalone runtime returns bot dictionaries, so the probe now selects an enabled bot dictionary and passes its `uuid` to `get_bot_info` and `send_message`. The probe also now subscribes to `MessageDeleted`.

## Standalone Runtime Plugin E2E Record

Verified again on May 10, 2026 with SDK standalone runtime, LangBot `--standalone-runtime`, Discord web client, the LangBot server, and `#🐞-debugging`.

Evidence:

- Main plugin JSONL: `data/temp/discord-plugin-e2e-20260510-final.jsonl`
- LangBot runtime log: `data/temp/discord-langbot-e2e-20260510-rerun.log`

Observed and verified:

- A newly invited Discord bot connected to the LangBot server and received a real web-client message in `#🐞-debugging`.
- `MessageReceived` reached the plugin with `bot_uuid=eba-discord-live`, `adapter_name=discord`, common `Source`/`Plain` message components, common `User`, and common `UserGroup` for the guild.
- SDK API calls succeeded: `get_langbot_version`, `get_bots`, `get_bot_info`, `send_message`, plugin storage, workspace storage, `list_plugins_manifest`, `list_commands`, `list_tools`, and `list_knowledge_bases`.
- Outbound component sweep succeeded: plain text plus user mention, `AtAll`/`@everyone`, base64 image, quoted reply, file attachment, and flattened forward fallback.
- Common APIs succeeded: `get_user_info`, `get_group_info`, `get_group_member_list`, and `get_group_member_info`.
- Discord platform APIs succeeded through `call_platform_api`: `get_channel`, `typing`, `get_guild`, `get_guild_channels`, and `get_guild_roles`.

Documented limits in this E2E run:

- Real Discord UI inbound attachment/image/file, reply/quote, and fresh mention-chain messages were not completed in the plugin E2E evidence. Outbound image/file attachments from the bot do not prove inbound attachment conversion.
- A later May 10 UI retry could write text into the Discord message box, but the client kept the send button disabled and did not send the message, so it produced no new plugin evidence.
- `get_message`, `get_friend_list`, and `get_group_list` are not supported by this Discord adapter.
- Destructive moderation and guild-leave APIs were not repeated against the shared LangBot server.
- Native Discord voice is not represented as common `Voice`; audio-like payloads are treated as file attachments.
- `create_invite`, pin/unpin, and reaction mutation were covered by prior direct live probes but were not repeated by the final plugin run to avoid extra shared-server side effects.
