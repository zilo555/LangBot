"""
PoC test for CWE-22 path traversal in LocalStorageProvider.

The LocalStorageProvider uses os.path.join(LOCAL_STORAGE_PATH, key) without
validating that the resulting path stays inside LOCAL_STORAGE_PATH.

When `key` is an absolute path (e.g. '/etc/passwd'), os.path.join discards
all previous components and returns the absolute path directly, allowing
arbitrary file reads, writes, and deletes.

This test must FAIL before the fix and PASS after.
